# **✨ Cult of the Bound Variable ✨** Universal Computing Machine Emulator

A Rust implementation of the [2006 ICFP programming contest](http://www.boundvariable.org/task.shtml) CPU. 

I'm not super interested in reverse enginering the binary they give (yet, anyways), but building an emulator for their weird assembly was pretty fun Sunday project. This is my first Rust program and is neither particularly fast nor elegant; I may or may not refactor this in the future.
